# Immunomodulatory Gut Microbiota Index (IMGMI)

The IMGM Index is a sample-based scoring metric that allows for estimation of the immunomodulatory properties of microbiota from IgA-SEQ or MIG-Seq data.

Users can infer both a species' immunomodulatory score and an individual's global immunomodulatory index by considering the relative abundance, prevalence and binding nature of a microbe to an immunoglobulin 
type.

# Immunomodulatory Gut Microbiota Index (IMGMI)

The IMGM Index is a sample-based scoring metric that allows for estimation of the immunomodulatory properties of microbiota from IgA-SEQ or MIG-Seq data.

Users can infer both a species' immunomodulatory score and an individual's global immunomodulatory index by considering the relative abundance, prevalence and binding nature of a microbe to an immunoglobulin 
type.


## Installation

a) IMGMI inference is available through an R package. You can install R and R Studio if you have not yet installed them.

b) Download the `IMGMIndex_0.1.0.tar.gz` file available in the repository

c) In R or R Studio, run ```install.packages("IMGMIndex_0.1.0.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")```
